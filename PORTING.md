# Porting map: netcoredbg → sharpdbg.mi xUnit tests

The Samsung/netcoredbg repo is included as a submodule at `netcoredbg/`. Its
`test-suite/` directory is the canonical reference for MI test scenarios.

**Why we can't use netcoredbg programs directly as debuggees:** netcoredbg test
apps are interwoven with `Label.Checkpoint` / `Label.Breakpoint` calls that depend
on the `NetcoreDbgTest` harness and target `netcoreapp3.1`. They are test scripts,
not standalone programs. We maintain equivalent standalone fixture apps in `test/`
that mirror the relevant data/code patterns without the harness overhead.

This document maps each xUnit test in `tests/SharpDbg.Mi.Tests/` to the original
netcoredbg MI script it is based on.

## Ported MI tests

### MiMode_LaunchAndBreakpointTests
- MI test: `tests/SharpDbg.Mi.Tests/MiMode_LaunchAndBreakpointTests.cs`
- Purpose: replicate the simple MI sequence that inserts breakpoints, runs the debuggee with `--stop-at-entry`, observes `*stopped` events, deletes the breakpoint, and exits cleanly.
- Original source: `netcoredbg/test-suite/MIExampleTest/Program.cs`
- Key anchors (approximate line numbers):
  - `Label.Checkpoint("init", "bp_test", …)` — line 175
  - breakpoint site: `Console.WriteLine("A breakpoint \"bp\" is set on this line"); Label.Breakpoint("bp");` — line 184
  - `Label.Checkpoint("bp_test", "bp2_test", …)` — line 186
  - `Label.Checkpoint("finish", "", …)` — line 195
- Status: Completed for the single-breakpoint flow and async stop handling; the original also exercises the second breakpoint (`bp2_test`) which can be ported later as an extension.

### MiMode_MITestBreakpointTests
- MI test: `tests/SharpDbg.Mi.Tests/MiMode_MITestBreakpointTests.cs`
- Purpose: provide a minimal MI flow that touches `break-insert`/`exec-run`, confirms the debugger reports the stop, and cleans up via `break-delete` and `gdb-exit`.
- Original source: `netcoredbg/test-suite/MITestBreakpoint/Program.cs`
- Key anchors:
  - `Label.Checkpoint("init", "BREAK1_test", …)` — line 220
  - `Label.Checkpoint("BREAK1_test", "BREAK3_test", …)` — line 295
  - later checkpoints covering ID-aware breakpoints (`BREAK3`, `BREAK4`, `FUNCBREAK*`) — lines 373‑416
- Status: Partial. The xUnit version currently validates the core insert/run/delete scenario but does not yet recreate the ID-based/function breakpoints, condition checks, or the `just-my-code` toggle present in the original.

### MiMode_EvaluateTests
- MI test: `tests/SharpDbg.Mi.Tests/MiMode_EvaluateTests.cs`
- Test app: `test/mi-integration/TestAppExpression/Program.cs` (shares the same expression fixture used for `MITestExpression`, with decimals/arrays/strings).
- Purpose: stop the debuggee, obtain a frame id, and exercise `data-evaluate-expression` across representative values (decimals, arrays, arithmetic, and strings) to ensure MI evaluation wiring is functional.
- Original source: `netcoredbg/test-suite/MITestEvaluate/Program.cs`
- Key anchors:
  - `Label.Checkpoint("init", "values_test", …)` — line 716
  - `Label.Checkpoint("values_test", "expression_test", …)` — line 753
  - extensive coverage of expression variants (nested tests, static members, lambdas, literals, conditionals, unary ops, function evaluation and coalescence) — lines 828‑1472
- Status: Partial. The SharpDbg test now asserts decimal formatting, array indexing, arithmetic, and string concatenation. Large portions of the original evaluate suite (operator overloads, comparisons, unary ops, and broader error cases) still remain.

### MiMode_EvaluateExpressionTests
- MI test: `tests/SharpDbg.Mi.Tests/MiMode_EvaluateExpressionTests.cs`
- Test app: `test/mi-integration/TestAppExpression/Program.cs` (builds the `a/b/tc/str` operands, bool flags, arrays, and static helpers that `MITestExpression` exercises so MI queries have concrete data).
- Purpose: mimic the MI sequence that sets breakpoints, uses `stack-list-frames` to read a frame id, and calls `data-evaluate-expression` for that frame, mirroring the workflow that exercises expressions tied to a stopped frame.
- Original source: `netcoredbg/test-suite/MITestExpression/Program.cs`
- Key anchors:
  - `Label.Checkpoint("init", "expression_test1", …)` — line 179
  - `Label.Checkpoint("expression_test1", "expression_test2", …)` — line 196
  - `Label.Checkpoint("expression_test2", "expression_test3", …)` — line 210
  - `Context.CalcAndCheckExpression(...)` blocks that evaluate `a + b`, `tc.a + b`, `str1 + str2`, `d + a`, and `a + 1` — lines 200‑251
  - `Label.Checkpoint("finish", "", …)` — line 225
- Status: Mostly ported. The SharpDbg test now hits the same expression breakpoints and validates `a + b`, `tc.a + b`, `str1 + str2`, `d + a`, `a + 1`, plus decimal values, array indexing, nullable coalescing, bool logic, and static helper results (e.g., `Program.Greeting`, `Program.Multiply`). Extended expression families (lambdas, conditional/unary operators, struct child navigation, etc.) still need formal porting.

### MiMode_VariablesTests
- MI test: `tests/SharpDbg.Mi.Tests/MiMode_VariablesTests.cs`
- Purpose: stop the target inside `TestApp1`, read the top frame, and exercise `data-evaluate-expression` both for a literal (`1+2`) and for the program variable `i` so we exercise real variable resolution and validation.
- Original source: `netcoredbg/test-suite/MITestVariables/Program.cs`
- Key anchors:
  - `Label.Checkpoint("init", "setup_var", …)` — line 536
  - `Label.Checkpoint("setup_var", "test_var", …)` — line 621
  - sequences that test debugger attributes, notifications, eval flags, timeouts, and exceptions — lines 1111‑1265
  - final cleanup block `Label.Checkpoint("finish", "", …)` — line 1265
- Status: Partial. SharpDbg now asserts an actual local value (the `i` variable from `TestApp1`) in addition to a synthetic arithmetic expression, but the richer `-var-*` coverage (attributes, eval flags, notify-of-cross-thread, timeout/exception handling) still needs to be ported.

### MiMode_SteppingTests
- MI test: `tests/SharpDbg.Mi.Tests/MiMode_SteppingTests.cs`
- Purpose: start the debuggee, insert a line breakpoint on the test apps, run to the breakpoint, and issue MI stepping commands such as `exec-next` and `exec-step` to confirm `*stopped` notifications arrive.
- Original source: `netcoredbg/test-suite/MITestStepping/Program.cs`
- Key anchors:
  - `Label.Checkpoint("init", "step1", …)` — line 324
  - successive checkpoints that exercise `step1`, `step2`, `step_in`, `step_over`, and the nested method calls inside `test_func1`/`test_func2` — lines 335‑376
  - further checkpoints that cover attribute-driven stepping, property accessors, cast handling, breakpoint stepping, and step arguments/compilation helpers — lines 399‑718
- Status: Partial. The SharpDbg test focuses on the basic `exec-next`/`exec-step` behavior. Full conditioning, attribute-, JMC-, and property-aware stepping scenarios still need to be ported from the netcore script, plus the richer fixture that generates many labeled breakpoints.

## Gaps & next steps

- Expand `MiMode_EvaluateTests` and `MiMode_EvaluateExpressionTests` to cover the remaining expression variants from `MITestExpression` and the nested value/child checks from `MITestEvaluate` (lambdas, static members, method calls, conditional/unary operators, and struct evaluations) beyond the sums already asserted.
- Port the remaining `-var-*` command coverage from `MITestVariables`, including attribute checks, `evalFlags`, notify-of-cross-thread, and timeout/exception handling.
- Broaden stepping coverage by porting additional checkpoints from `MITestStepping` (JMC/step filtering toggles, property accessor breakpoints, argument/compilation checks, etc.).
- Track other MI suites that still need porting (e.g., `MITestAsyncStepping`, `MITestException`, `MITestEvalArraysIndexers`, `MITestHotReload*`, and the larger `MITest*` family listed under `netcoredbg/test-suite`). Use this doc to call out whichever suite you pick next so we can keep the table up to date.
